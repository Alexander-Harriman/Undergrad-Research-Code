This folder consists of code used during my two undergraduate research programs:

- EUREKA! Research program (Summer 2019). The project consisted of a team of two students investigating Perfectionism in the Clemson Honors College.
- The result was a published poster presented during Fall 2019.

- COURAGE Research program (Summer 2020). The project consisted of a team of three students investigating Extreme Value Analysis on TSA Claim data to determine the worst-case scenario for payouts the TSA would pay to passengers.
- The result was a poster presented to a panel of Clemson professors through Zoom and an individual poster created and shared at the end of the project.
